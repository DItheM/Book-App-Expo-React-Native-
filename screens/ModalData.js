      title: "The Call of the Wild",
      author: "Jack London",
      description: "The Call of the Wild is a novel by Jack London published in 1903. The story is set in the Yukon during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush—a period in which strong sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's central character is a dog named Buck, a domesticated dog living at a ranch in the Santa Clara Valley of California as the story opens. Stolen from his home and sold into service as sled dog in Alaska, he reverts to a wild state. Buck is forced to fight in order to dominate other dogs in a harsh climate. Eventually he sheds the veneer of civilization, relying on primordial instincts and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.London lived for most of a year in the Yukon collecting material for the book. The story was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903; a month later it was released in book form. The novel’s great popularity and success made a reputation for London. Much of its appeal derives from the simplicity of this tale of survival. As early as 1908 the story was adapted to film and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations.",

America’s bloodiest war was coming to an end and many displaced families from every corner of the land in search of new homes, land, and even gold were heading west., unaware of the dangers that awaited. With the natives continually striving to make peace, and politicians and soldiers repeatedly breaking treaties and forcing tribes onto smaller and smaller reservations, the people had had enough. The Indian wars of the west would soon cause the lands to run red with the blood of settlers, soldiers, and natives alike. Into this melee, Reuben and Elly Grundy are dispatched in an effort to keep disgruntled renegade rebels from wreaking havoc.",

The “slow horses,” as they’re called, have all disgraced themselves in some way to get relegated there. Maybe they botched an Op so badly they can’t be trusted anymore. Maybe they got in the way of an ambitious colleague and had the rug yanked out from under them. Maybe they just got too dependent on the bottle—not unusual in this line of work. One thing they have in common, though, is they want to be back in the action. And most of them would do anything to get there─even if it means having to collaborate with one another.",
